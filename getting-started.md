# 2. Getting Started with Git

This section will walk you through installing Git on your computer, performing the essential initial configuration, and creating your very first repository.

## Installing Git

Git is freely available for all major operating systems.

*   **macOS:** The easiest way to install Git is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you have Homebrew, simply open your terminal and run:
    ```/dev/null/install.sh#L1-1
    brew install git
    ```
    Alternatively, you can install it as part of the Xcode Command Line Tools.

*   **Windows:** The official build can be downloaded from the [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) website. This package includes both the command-line tool and a graphical user interface (Git GUI).

*   **Linux:** You can typically install Git through your distribution's package manager.
    *   For Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions:
        ```/dev/null/install.sh#L1-1
        sudo apt-get install git
        ```
    *   For Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:
        ```/dev/null/install.sh#L1-1
        sudo yum install git
        ```

To verify that Git was installed correctly, you can open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run:

```/dev/null/verify.sh#L1-1
git --version
```

This command should return the version of Git you have installed, for example `git version 2.37.1`.

## First-Time Git Configuration

Before you start using Git, you need to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating.

Run the following commands in your terminal, replacing the example text with your own name and email.

```/dev/null/config.sh#L1-2
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

The `--global` flag tells Git that you want to use this configuration for every project you work on. If you need to use a different name or email for a specific project, you can run the same command *without* the `--global` flag from inside that project's directory.

It's also a good practice to set the name of the default branch. Historically, this branch was named `master`, but the community standard is now `main`.

```/dev/null/config.sh#L1-1
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

To check your configuration settings, you can use:

```/dev/null/config.sh#L1-1
git config --list
```

## Creating Your First Repository

A **repository** (or "repo") is a directory where Git tracks all the files and folders of your project.

To create a new repository, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
    ```/dev/null/mkdir.sh#L1-2
    mkdir my-first-project
    cd my-first-project
    ```

2.  Initialize a Git repository.
    ```/dev/null/init.sh#L1-1
    git init
    ```

Git will respond with something like: `Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my-first-project/.git/`

This command creates a hidden subdirectory named `.git` that contains all of your repository's history and metadata. This `.git` folder is the heart of your repository.

And that's it! You now have a fully functional Git repository, ready to start tracking your project's history.

Now that your repository is set up, let's learn the basic commands you'll use every day.
